Welcome to my Zombies Map Randomizer!

This is a fairly simple program developed by myself using Python.
It exhibits the use of control flow (if-else), while and for loops, and using arrays.

This program is for COD: Zombies players who want to spice up their games.
It allows them to randomize maps and/or specific challenges on those maps.

To run the program, simply open up a cmd terminal **in the directory where the py file is located**.
Afterwards, execute the following statement:
python zombieschallenges1.0py
